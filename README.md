# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project simulates building a full-featured booking platform similar to Airbnb. It emphasizes backend development, API security, database design, and DevOps workflows. This project helps developers grow their technical and collaborative skills while building scalable, secure software.

### Project Goals
- Practice collaborative workflows using GitHub.
- Design and build a robust backend architecture.
- Secure API endpoints and sensitive data.
- Implement CI/CD for efficient deployments.
- Integrate tools like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL into a cohesive project.

---

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Ensure the platform is user-friendly and intuitive for both hosts and guests.
- Emphasize clarity and simplicity in booking workflows.
- Use consistent styles and spacing to improve usability and aesthetics.
- Implement responsive design for all screens (mobile, tablet, desktop).

### Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a list of available properties with thumbnail images, price per night, and brief descriptions. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Provides detailed information about a selected property including photos, host details, amenities, reviews, and location map. |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Summarizes the booking, collects payment details, and finalizes the transaction securely. |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
- Enhances user satisfaction and trust.
- Reduces drop-off rates during booking.
- Supports accessibility for all users.
- Encourages repeat usage and recommendations.

### Design Properties from Figma

- **Color Styles**:
  - Primary: `#FF5A5F` (Airbnb Red)
  - Secondary: `#484848` (Dark Grey)
  - Background: `#F7F7F7`
  - Accent: `#00A699`

- **Typography**:
  - Font Family: `Circular Std`, `sans-serif`
  - Font Weights: Light (300), Regular (400), Medium (500), Bold (700)
  - Font Sizes:
    - Heading: 24px â€“ 32px
    - Body: 16px
    - Caption: 12px

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
- Ensures consistent branding and layout.
- Accelerates the development process by providing a design blueprint.
- Improves communication between designers and developers.

## UI Component Patterns

We plan to build reusable and scalable components across the project. The main UI components include:

- **Navbar**: Sticky navigation bar with links to home, properties, login/logout.
- **Property Card**: Shows property thumbnail, title, price, and rating in grid layout.
- **Footer**: Displays company info, links, and legal disclaimers at the bottom.
- **Search Bar**: Allows users to filter properties based on location, date, and guests.
- **Booking Form**: Captures booking details including dates and guest information.
- **Review Modal**: Popup form for users to leave a rating and comment after a stay.
- **Login/Register Forms**: Secure forms for user authentication and registration.

## Team Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Backend Developer** | Designs and implements APIs, handles server-side logic, and integrates databases. |
| **Database Administrator** | Designs the schema, optimizes queries, and ensures data integrity. |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages containerization, and automates deployments. |

---

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Django** | High-level Python web framework used to build scalable APIs. |
| **MySQL** | Relational database to store user, property, booking, and payment data. |
| **GraphQL** | API query language used to optimize frontend-backend data interactions. |
| **Docker** | Used to containerize the app for consistent environments. |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD tool for automating testing and deployment workflows. |

## Database Design

### Entities and Fields:
- **User**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `created_at`
- **Property**: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `location`, `price`
- **Booking**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`
- **Review**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
- **Payment**: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`

### Relationships:
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** is linked to one **User**, one **Property**, and one **Payment**.

---

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**: Sign up, login, view/edit profiles, secure authentication.
- **Property Management**: Hosts can list properties with photos, prices, and descriptions.
- **Booking System**: Guests can book properties, manage check-in/check-out dates.
- **Review System**: Users can review properties after booking.
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment handling for bookings using Stripe or similar service.

---

## API Security

- **Authentication**: Secure login with hashed passwords and token-based sessions (e.g., JWT).
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (host vs guest).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with IP throttling.
- **Input Validation**: Prevent SQL injections and XSS via strict validation.
- **HTTPS**: All communications will be encrypted to protect sensitive data.

**Why security matters:**
- Protects user data (emails, passwords)
- Secures financial transactions (payment processing)
- Maintains trust and platform integrity

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates testing and deployment to make code delivery faster and more reliable.

### Tools:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate tests and deployment workflows.
- **Docker**: Standardize development and production environments.
- **Deployment platforms**: Render, Heroku, or Fly.io.

### Benefits:
- Reduces manual errors during deployment.
- Increases productivity through automation.
- Ensures rapid feedback and consistent updates.
