# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project simulates building a full-featured booking platform similar to Airbnb. It emphasizes backend development, API security, database design, and DevOps workflows. This project helps developers grow their technical and collaborative skills while building scalable, secure software.

### Project Goals
- Practice collaborative workflows using GitHub.
- Design and build a robust backend architecture.
- Secure API endpoints and sensitive data.
- Implement CI/CD for efficient deployments.
- Integrate tools like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL into a cohesive project.

## Team Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Backend Developer** | Designs and implements APIs, handles server-side logic, and integrates databases. |
| **Database Administrator** | Designs the schema, optimizes queries, and ensures data integrity. |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages containerization, and automates deployments. |
| **Security Engineer** | Focuses on application-level security: authentication, authorization, data encryption, etc. |
| **Technical Writer** | Documents APIs, features, and processes to ensure clarity and maintainability. |

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Django** | High-level Python web framework used to build scalable APIs. |
| **MySQL** | Relational database to store user, property, booking, and payment data. |
| **GraphQL** | API query language used to optimize frontend-backend data interactions. |
| **Docker** | Used to containerize the app for consistent environments. |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD tool for automating testing and deployment workflows. |

## Database Design

### Entities and Fields:
- **User**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `created_at`
- **Property**: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `location`, `price`
- **Booking**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`
- **Review**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
- **Payment**: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`

### Relationships:
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** is linked to one **User**, one **Property**, and one **Payment**.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**: Sign up, login, view/edit profiles, secure authentication.
- **Property Management**: Hosts can list properties with photos, prices, and descriptions.
- **Booking System**: Guests can book properties, manage check-in/check-out dates.
- **Review System**: Users can review properties after booking.
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment handling for bookings using Stripe or similar service.

---

## API Security

- **Authentication**: Secure login with hashed passwords and token-based sessions (e.g., JWT).
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (host vs guest).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with IP throttling.
- **Input Validation**: Prevent SQL injections and XSS via strict validation.
- **HTTPS**: All communications will be encrypted to protect sensitive data.

**Why security matters:**
- Protects user data (emails, passwords)
- Secures financial transactions (payment processing)
- Maintains trust and platform integrity

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates testing and deployment to make code delivery faster and more reliable.

### Tools:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate tests and deployment workflows.
- **Docker**: Standardize development and production environments.
- **Deployment platforms**: Render, Heroku, or Fly.io.

### Benefits:
- Reduces manual errors during deployment.
- Increases productivity through automation.
- Ensures rapid feedback and consistent updates.
